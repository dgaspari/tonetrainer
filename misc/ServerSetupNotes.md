#Notes for setting up a new server:
###I. Setting up web server
* Install git if its not already avaiable
* Get code - clone from: https://github.com/dgaspari/tonetrainer.git
* Install node, npm, grunt, bower, ...

###II. Setting up Python
* Get code - clone from: https://github.com/dgaspari/pyrapt.git
* Get Python 2.7 setup
** Is this a dedicated server? Just get Python 2.7 installed
** Otherwise get virtualenvwrapper and setup a virtualenv w 2.7 - this lets you install all the necessary packages independnet of everything else
